# rock-paper-scissors

Description:
This game is a JS project for console use only (for now). It gets a random generated choice from the computer, then asks the player to give one. After 5 rounds a winner is decided if there is one. If not a tie alert will be given. This project is meant to improve my basic JS and Problem Solving skills.

UPDATE:
With this update the webpage has been added and the game now ends once the player or the pc reaches 5 points, as per the projects requirements. The JS file has been of course reworked/rewritten to work with the UI.
